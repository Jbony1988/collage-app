### Tasks for Collage Application

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.x on your system.
   - Install required libraries: Pillow and pillow_heif using pip:
     ```
     pip install Pillow pillow_heif
     ```
   - Understand the purpose of each library: Pillow for image processing and pillow_heif for HEIC image support.

2. **Understand the Code Structure**:
   - Study the import statements and their purposes:
     - PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation
     - os for file and directory operations
     - math for mathematical operations (though not used in this version)
     - pillow_heif for HEIC image format support
   - Understand the significance of registering the HEIF opener.

3. **Implement Image Conversion**:
   - Analyze the `convert_heic_to_jpg` function:
     - How it opens HEIC files
     - The process of creating a new file path for JPG
     - Saving the image in JPEG format
   - Consider error handling for this function.

4. **Create the Collage Function**:
   - Study the `create_collage` function parameters and their purposes:
     - folder_path: source of images
     - output_path: where to save the collage
     - base_image_size: initial size of images
     - scale_factor: for resizing images
     - frame_width: width of the decorative frame
   - Understand the image collection process:
     - How it filters for supported image formats
     - The use of a set to avoid duplicates
     - The process of converting HEIC images
   - Analyze the sorting of image paths and why it's done.

5. **Determine Layout**:
   - Study the layout calculation logic:
     - 2x2 layout for 4 or fewer images
     - 3x2 layout for 5 to 6 images
     - 3x3 layout for more than 6 images
   - Consider the implications of this layout strategy on the final collage.

6. **Calculate Sizes**:
   - Understand the calculation of scaled image size and collage dimensions:
     - How base_image_size and scale_factor affect the final image size
     - The role of frame_width in collage size calculations

7. **Create Collage Canvas**:
   - Analyze the creation of the blank collage image:
     - The use of 'RGBA' mode for transparency support
     - Setting the background color

8. **Paste Images**:
   - Study the image pasting process:
     - How images are opened, resized, and converted to RGBA
     - The calculation of x and y offsets for image placement
     - The use of the alpha channel in pasting

9. **Add Decorative Frame**:
   - Understand the process of adding the flower frame:
     - Loading and resizing the flower image
     - The logic for placing flowers along the edges
     - How transparency is maintained in the pasting process

10. **Save and Display the Collage**:
    - Analyze the saving and display methods used
    - Understand the information printed about the collage

11. **Test the Application**:
    - Create a test folder with various image types (including HEIC if possible)
    - Run the script and analyze the output
    - Experiment with different parameters (e.g., scale_factor, frame_width)

12. **Document Findings and Challenges**:
    - Write a report covering:
      - The overall functionality of the script
      - Any challenges faced in understanding or running the code
      - Suggestions for improvements or additional features

### Additional Considerations for Students:

- **Image Processing Concepts**: Research and understand concepts like image resizing, color modes (RGB vs RGBA), and alpha channels.
- **File Handling**: Study how the script handles different file types and manages file paths.
- **Error Handling**: Consider where error handling could be improved in the script.
- **Code Efficiency**: Analyze the code for potential optimizations, especially in the image processing loops.
- **User Interface**: Think about how you might add a simple user interface to make the script more user-friendly.
